DEAD DROP
YOUR FINAL DROP

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT IT IS

You're gonna die.
Your phone won't.

500GB of screenshots. 10,000 memes. Inside jokes nobody will understand. 
The real story of what happened that night. Your actual personality, compressed 
into folders labeled "if u see this im dead lol"

Where does it go? Your next of kin who doesn't know your password? 
Apple's iCloud cemetery? Nowhere?

Fuck that.

DEAD DROP is a dead man's switch for your digital soul.

THE PRODUCT

DROP VAULTS

Create drops. Load them with whatever.

- THE VAULT – Too spicy for alive-you
- RECEIPTS – The truth, timestamped
- GROUPCHAT NUKE – Your magnum opus, delivered to the thread
- CONFESSIONAL – Clear your conscience, unclear your browser history
- TIMEBOMB – Scheduled for your funeral, your birthday, whenever

Each vault = its own release schedule, its own executors, its own trigger.

EXECUTORS

Pick who hits the button.

Not your family. Not your lawyer. Your friend who would actually do it. 
The groupchat. The ex who deserves to know. Nobody, and let the timer run out.

They get keys. Not all keys. Just theirs.

When you go dark, they decide: was it a vacation or the big one?

TRIGGERS

AUTO:
- 90 days offline (soft)
- 180 days offline (probable)
- 1 year offline (yeah it happened)
- Apple Health flatline (dark mode activated)

MANUAL:
- Death certificate upload
- 3/5 executor vote
- "Fuck it, send it now" button (while alive, for chaos)

SCHEDULED:
- Your funeral (they'll be checking their phones anyway)
- Your birthday, 5 years later
- New Year's 2050
- When you would've turned 69

72-hour failsafe on everything. If you're actually alive, you can cancel 
from any device. If you're not... it's too late anyway.

THE EXPERIENCE

WHILE ALIVE:

Monthly "PROOF OF LIFE"
Check-in or your countdown starts. Miss it = executors get a ping.
Gamified because anxiety is better with points.

VAULT PREVIEW MODE
See your own memorial. Cringe. Edit. Repeat.
"You'll reach approximately 247 people. That's more than your last post."

COLLABORATIVE DROPS
Invite friends to co-author a time capsule.
"Remember when we..." but make it a legal document.

AFTER DEATH:

MEMORIAL WALL
Your drop goes live. Public or private.
Friends can:
- React (💀 😭 🕊️ 😂)
- Add their own screenshots of you
- Remix your memes
- Comment threads for 1000 years

VIRAL MECHANIC:
Every executor you add gets invited to make their own vault.
Death is the ultimate referral program.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BRAND SYSTEM

COLORS:
- Black (death)
- White (peace)
- Red (the button)
- No gradients. No pastels. No startup shit.

TYPE:
- Helvetica Bold for headers (DEAD SERIOUS)
- Arial for body (we're not trying that hard)
- Comic Sans for premium tier (because fuck you, that's why)

LOGO:
Literally just a tombstone emoji: 🪦
Or a skull: 💀
Or both.
No custom illustrations. No branding agency. Just Unicode and vibes.

COPY VOICE EXAMPLES:

"ERROR 404: YOU DEAD"

"VAULT CREATED
(Good luck being remembered for this)"

"EXECUTOR ADDED
They'll either honor your memory or leak everything"

"NOBODY'S CHECKED ON YOU IN 60 DAYS
Should we be worried?"

"PREMIUM UNLOCKED: ETERNAL PLAN
$49/year, forever
(Well, not YOUR forever)"

GO-TO-MARKET (THE CHAOS PLAN)

PHASE 1: STEALTH
Build it. Tell nobody. Invite 100 people. Watch what happens.

PHASE 2: STUNT
The fake death. The viral drop. The media freakout.
Articles write themselves:
- "Is This Death App Genius or Dystopian?"
- "Gen Z Startup Wants to Disrupt Dying"
- "I Tried the Death Meme App and Now I'm Existential"

PHASE 3: DROPS
Weekly invite waves. Waitlist grows. FOMO intensifies.
People asking "when's my drop?"

PHASE 4: UBIQUITY
Becomes the standard.
"Did you set up your Dead Drop yet?"
Like asking if someone has a will, but less boring.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PARTNERSHIPS (UNHOLY ALLIANCES)

- Funeral homes (they know what's up)
- Life insurance companies (ironic sponsorship opportunities)
- Therapy apps (cross-promote grief support)
- Archive.org (become the Internet Archive for personal legacies)
- Dating apps (new profile field: "Dead Drop executor?")

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY THIS EXISTS

Because death is the one thing capitalism hasn't fully colonized yet.

Because your digital life is worth more than your login credentials.

Because funeral homes charge $10k for a box and we charge $49 for forever.

Because everyone jokes about dying but nobody actually plans for it.

Because your memes deserve to outlive you.

Because this is less weird than cryogenics.

Because we made it and now it exists.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FINAL TRANSMISSION

This isn't a startup.
It's a statement.

Death is inevitable.
Cringe is optional.
Your memes are forever.
