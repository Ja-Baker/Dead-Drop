AI BUILD PROMPT: DEAD DROP
A Digital Legacy Platform

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROJECT BRIEF

Build a mobile-first application called DEAD DROP that allows users to create 
posthumous content releases. Think: dead man's switch meets meme archive meets 
digital will.

Core concept: Users curate vaults of digital content (memes, messages, media) 
that get released to chosen "executors" after death or extended inactivity.

Brand tone: MSCHF-style — brutally honest, darkly humorous, zero corporate speak, 
maximum cultural awareness.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS:
- React Native for iOS (priority) and Android
- Node.js/Express backend
- PostgreSQL database
- AWS S3 for media storage
- Redis for session management and trigger monitoring
- End-to-end encryption (AES-256)

CORE SYSTEMS TO BUILD:

1. USER AUTHENTICATION
   - Email/password signup
   - 2FA mandatory for premium users
   - Biometric unlock for app access
   - Session management with auto-logout

2. VAULT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
   - Create/edit/delete vaults
   - Upload multiple content types:
     * Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
     * Videos (MP4, MOV - max 5min for premium)
     * Audio (MP3, M4A - voice memos)
     * Text notes (encrypted)
     * URLs (auto-preview generation)
   - Folder organization within vaults
   - Preview mode (see vault as executor would)

   - Manual triggers:
     * Death certificate upload + verification
     * Multi-executor confirmation vote
     * Scheduled releases (date-based)
   - 72-hour cancellation window:
     * User can abort trigger from any logged-in device
     * Executors notified of cancellation
   - Notification service for executors

5. MEMORIAL WALL (POST-RELEASE)
   - Public or private vault pages
   - Custom URL slugs (premium)
   - Social features:
     * Emoji reactions

     * Upload tribute content
     * Share to social media
   - Content moderation tools
   - Analytics (views, engagement)

6. PROOF OF LIFE SYSTEM

FINAL NOTES

This is not a typical app build. The product is inherently provocative. 
The design should make people slightly uncomfortable. The copy should never 
soften the reality of death.

Build something that feels like MSCHF made it:
- Stripped down
- Brutally honest
- Culturally aware
- Technically solid
- Slightly dangerous

Death is inevitable. This app should feel inevitable too.

DEAD DROP
Build it.
